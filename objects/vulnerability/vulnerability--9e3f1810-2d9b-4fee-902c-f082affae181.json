            "description": "Mifos-Mobile Android Application for MifosX is an Android Application built on top of the MifosX Self-Service platform. Mifos-Mobile before commit e505f62 disables HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP client. Additionally it accepted any self-signed certificate as valid. Hostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. Accepting any certificate, even self-signed ones allows man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is fixed in mifos-mobile commit e505f62.",
