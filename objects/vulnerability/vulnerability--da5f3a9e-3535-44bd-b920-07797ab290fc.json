            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Malwarebytes Antimalware 3.6.1.2711. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious web page. There is an issue with the way the product handles URIs within certain schemes. The product does not warn the user that a dangerous navigation is about to take place. Because special characters in the URI are not sanitized, this could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user at medium integrity. Was ZDI-CAN-7162.",
