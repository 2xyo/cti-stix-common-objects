            "description": "An exploitable vulnerability exists the safe browsing function of the CUJO Smart Firewall, version 7003. The bug lies in the way the safe browsing function parses HTTP requests. The \"Host\" header is incorrectly extracted from captured HTTP requests, which would allow an attacker to visit any malicious websites and bypass the firewall. An attacker could send an HTTP request to exploit this vulnerability.",
