            "description": "A local elevation of privilege using physical access security vulnerability was found in HPE Proliant Gen10 Servers using Intel Innovation Engine (IE). This attack requires a physical attack to the server motherboard. To mitigate this issue, ensure your server is always physically secured. HPE will not address this issue in the impacted Gen 10 servers listed. HPE recommends using appropriate physical security methods as a compensating control to disallow an attacker from having physical access to the server main circuit board.",
