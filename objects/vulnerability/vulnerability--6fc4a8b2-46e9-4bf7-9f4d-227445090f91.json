            "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access the shell of the underlying Linux operating system on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain shell access with a nonroot user account to the underlying Linux operating system on the affected device and potentially access system configuration files with sensitive information. This vulnerability only affects console connections from CIMC. It does not apply to remote connections, such as telnet or SSH.",
