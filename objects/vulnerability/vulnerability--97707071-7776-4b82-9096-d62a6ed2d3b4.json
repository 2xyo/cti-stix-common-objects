The cookie used to convey the CSRF prevention token is not annotated with the \u201csecure\u201d attribute, which allows an attacker with the ability to MITM plain HTTP requests to obtain it, if the user mistakenly uses a HTTP instead of HTTPS address to access the server. This cookie value could then be used to perform CSRF.",
