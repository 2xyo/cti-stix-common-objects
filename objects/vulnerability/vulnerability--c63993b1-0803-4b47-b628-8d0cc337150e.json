            "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 through Update 11, 6 through Update 38, 5.0 through Update 38, and 1.4.2_40 and earlier, and OpenJDK 6 and 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via vectors related to JAXP.  NOTE: the previous information is from the February 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to the public declaration of the loadPropertyFile method in the JAXP FuncSystemProperty class, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information.",
