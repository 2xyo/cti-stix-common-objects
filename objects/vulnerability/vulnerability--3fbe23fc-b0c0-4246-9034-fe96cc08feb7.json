A directory traversal vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to move arbitrary files, which can result in code execution, compromising confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system. Successful exploitation requires a network connection to the affected device. The attacker does not need privileges or special conditions of the system, but user interaction is required.",
