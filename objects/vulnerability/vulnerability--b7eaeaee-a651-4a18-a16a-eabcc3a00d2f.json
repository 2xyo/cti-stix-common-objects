NOTE: the previous information is from the February 2013 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to CPU consumption in the SSL/TLS implementation via a large number of ClientHello packets that are not properly handled by (1) ClientHandshaker.java and (2) ServerHandshaker.java.",
