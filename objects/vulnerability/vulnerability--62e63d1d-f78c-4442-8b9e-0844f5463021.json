Through the PUK signature functionality, an administrator will not have access to the current p12 certificate and password. When accessing this functionality, the administrator has the option to replace the current certificate and it is not possible to view the certificate password (p12) already deployed on the platform. The replacement p12 certificate returns to users in base64 with its password, which can be accessed by non-administrator users.",
