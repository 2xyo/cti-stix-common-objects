            "description": "An issue was discovered in Cloudera Manager 5.x through 5.15.0. One type of page in Cloudera Manager uses a 'returnUrl' parameter to redirect the user to another page in Cloudera Manager once a wizard is completed. The validity of this parameter was not checked. As a result, the user could be automatically redirected to an attacker's external site or perform a malicious JavaScript function that results in cross-site scripting (XSS). This was fixed by not allowing any value in the returnUrl parameter with patterns such as http://, https://, //, or javascript. The only exceptions to this rule are the SAML Login/Logout URLs, which remain supported since they are explicitly configured and they are not passed via the returnUrl parameter.",
