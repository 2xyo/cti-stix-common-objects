            "description": "Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a \"URL Handler\" in the Windows registry. *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66.",
