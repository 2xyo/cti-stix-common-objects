In the case of a default installation without a security realm reference, an attacker can successfully access the server without authentication. NOTE: the Security Realms documentation in the product's Admin Guide indicates that \"without a security realm reference\" implies \"effectively unsecured.\" The vendor explicitly supports these unsecured configurations because they have valid use cases during development.",
