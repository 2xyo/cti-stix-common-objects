            "description": "Some Xerox printers (such as the Phaser 3320 V53.006.16.000) were affected by one or more stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Google Cloud Print implementation that would allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device. This was caused by an insecure handling of the register parameters, because the size used within a memcpy() function, which copied the action value into a local variable, was not checked properly.",
