            "description": "Before Thornberry NDoc version 8.0, laptop clients and the server have default database (Cache) users set up with a single password. This password is left behind in a cleartext log file during client installation on laptops. This password can be used to gain full admin/system access to client devices (if no firewall is present) or the NDoc server itself. Once the password is known to an attacker, local access is not required.",
