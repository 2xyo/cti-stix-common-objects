            "description": "Rockwell Automation RSLinx Enterprise Software (LogReceiver.exe) CPR9, CPR9-SR1, CPR9-SR2, CPR9-SR3, CPR9-SR4, CPR9-SR5, CPR9-SR5.1, and CPR9-SR6 does not handle input correctly and results in a logic error if it calculates an incorrect value for the \u201cEnd of Current Record\u201d field. By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the \u201cRecord Data Size\u201d field modified to a specifically oversized value, the service will calculate an undersized value for the \u201cTotal Record Size.\u201d Then the service will calculate an incorrect value for the \u201cEnd of Current Record\u201d field causing access violations that lead to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot.
