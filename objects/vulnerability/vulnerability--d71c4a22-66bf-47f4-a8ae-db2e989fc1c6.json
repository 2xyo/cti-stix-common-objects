This vulnerability is due to a parsing issue on DNS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS packets through routers that are running an affected version and have NBAR enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
