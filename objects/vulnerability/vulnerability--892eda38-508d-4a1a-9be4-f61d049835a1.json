The vulnerability is due to improper validation of HTTP and HTTPS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP or HTTPS request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a restart of the web proxy process, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.",
