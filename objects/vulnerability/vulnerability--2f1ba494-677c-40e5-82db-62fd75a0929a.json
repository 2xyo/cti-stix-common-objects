NOTE: The previous information was obtained from the January 2013 Oracle CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to an incorrect comparison in the vga_draw_text function in Devices/Graphics/DevVGA.cpp, which can cause VirtualBox to \"draw more lines than necessary.\"",
