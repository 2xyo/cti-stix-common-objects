            "description": "A command injection flaw identified in the nslookup API in Silver Peak Unity ECOSTM (ECOS) appliance software could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server running on the EdgeConnect appliance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to establish an interactive channel, effectively taking control of the target system. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with authenticated access to the Orchestrator UI or EdgeConnect UI. This affects all ECOS versions prior to : 8.1.9.15, 8.3.0.8, 8.3.1.2, 8.3.2.0, 9.0.2.0, and 9.1.0.0.",
