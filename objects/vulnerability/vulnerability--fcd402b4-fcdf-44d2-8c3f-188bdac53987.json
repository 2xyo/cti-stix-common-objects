            "description": "A CSV Injection (also known as Formula Injection) vulnerability in the Marmind web application with version 4.1.141.0 allows malicious users to gain remote control of other computers. By providing formula code in the \u201cNotes\u201d functionality in the main screen, an attacker can inject a payload into the \u201cDescription\u201d field under the \u201cInsert To-Do\u201d option. Other users might download this data, for example a CSV file, and execute the malicious commands on their computer by opening the file using a software such as Microsoft Excel. The attacker could gain remote access to the user\u2019s PC.",
