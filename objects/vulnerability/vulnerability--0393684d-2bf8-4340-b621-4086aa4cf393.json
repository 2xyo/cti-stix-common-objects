            "description": "In Lenovo Connect2 versions earlier than 4.2.5.4885 for Windows and 4.2.5.3071 for Android, when an ad-hoc connection is made between two systems for the purpose of sharing files, the password for this ad-hoc connection will be stored in a user-readable location. An attacker with read access to the user's contents could connect to the Connect2 hotspot and see the contents of files while they are being transferred between the two systems.",
