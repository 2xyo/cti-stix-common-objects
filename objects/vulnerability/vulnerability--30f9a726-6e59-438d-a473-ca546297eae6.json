            "description": "In LabCup before <v2_next_18022, it is possible to use the save API to perform unauthorized actions for users without access to user management in order to, after successful exploitation, gain access to a victim's account. A user without the user-management privilege can change another user's email address if the attacker knows details of the victim such as the exact roles and group roles, ID, and remote authentication ID settings. These must be sent in a modified save API request. It was fixed in 6.3.0.03.",
