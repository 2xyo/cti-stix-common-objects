The vulnerability is due to incomplete input and validation checking mechanisms in the REST API URL request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious URL to the REST API. If successful, an exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive system information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg89442.",
