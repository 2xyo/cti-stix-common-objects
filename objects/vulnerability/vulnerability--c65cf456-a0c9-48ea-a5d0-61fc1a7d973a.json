NOTE: the previous information is from the February 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to cross-site scripting (XSS) in the sun.rmi.transport.proxy CGIHandler class that does not properly handle error messages in a (1) command or (2) port number.",
