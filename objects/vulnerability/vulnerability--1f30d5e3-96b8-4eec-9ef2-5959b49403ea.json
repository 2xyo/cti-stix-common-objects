            "description": "** DISPUTED **  Guidance Software EnCase allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service via (1) a corrupted Microsoft Exchange database, which triggers an application crash when many options are selected; (2) a corrupted NTFS filesystem, which causes the application to report \"memory allocation errors;\" or (3) deeply nested directories, which trigger an application crash during an Expand All action. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of these vectors because the user can select fewer options, there is no operational impact, or the user can do less expansion.",
