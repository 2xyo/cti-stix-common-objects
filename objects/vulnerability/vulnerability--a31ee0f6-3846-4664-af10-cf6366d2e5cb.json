            "description": "LineageOS 16.0 and earlier is affected by: Incorrect Access Control. The impact is: The property checked by `adb root` can also be set in a normal adb shell session. The component is: adb shell (patches to fix this are at https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_system_core/+/234800, https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_device_lineage_sepolicy/+/234799). The attack vector is: When adb is enabled, and an attacker has physical access, `adb shell setprop service.adb.root 1` allows restarting adb as root.",
