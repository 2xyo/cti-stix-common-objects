            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meeting Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
