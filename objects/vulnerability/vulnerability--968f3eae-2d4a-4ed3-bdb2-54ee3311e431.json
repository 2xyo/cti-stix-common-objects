Successfully exploiting this issue may allow a less-privileged user to leak information from a privileged process running on a system where Horizon Connection Server, Horizon Agent or Horizon Client are installed. Note: This issue doesn't apply to Horizon 6, 7 Agents installed on Linux systems or Horizon Clients installed on non-Windows systems.",
