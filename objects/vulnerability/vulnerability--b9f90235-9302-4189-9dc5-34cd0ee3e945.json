A specially crafted XML cache file written to a specific location on the device can be used to inject OS commands. An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file.At 0x1ea28 the extracted type value from the xml file is used as an argument to /etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=X1 state=enabled config-type=<contents of type node> using sprintf(). This command is later executed via a call to system().",
