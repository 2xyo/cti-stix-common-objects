            "description": "A vulnerability in the Secure Login Enhancements capability of Cisco Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected Nexus 1000V Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) to become inaccessible to users through the CLI. The vulnerability is due to improper resource allocation during failed CLI login attempts when login parameters that are part of the Secure Login Enhancements capability are configured on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a high amount of login attempts against the affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to become inaccessible to other users, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition requiring a manual power cycle of the VSM to recover.",
