            "description": "A partial authentication bypass vulnerability exists on Mediatek MT7620N 1.06 devices. The vulnerability allows sending an unencrypted data frame to a WPA2-protected WLAN router where the packet is routed through the network. If successful, a response is sent back as an encrypted frame, which would allow an attacker to discern information or potentially modify data.",
