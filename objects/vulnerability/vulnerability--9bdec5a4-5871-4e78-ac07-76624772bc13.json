NOTE: the previous information is from the October 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this issue is an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or conduct SMB Relay attacks via a crafted DTD in an XML request to OA_HTML/IspPunchInServlet.",
