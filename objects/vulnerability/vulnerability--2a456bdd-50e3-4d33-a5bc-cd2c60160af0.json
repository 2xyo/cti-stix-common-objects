            "description": "The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue.  NOTE: the vendor states \"This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387\"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.",
