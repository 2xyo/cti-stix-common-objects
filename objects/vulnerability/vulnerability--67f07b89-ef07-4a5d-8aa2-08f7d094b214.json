            "description": "A vulnerability in the loading mechanism of specific DLLs in the Cisco Webex Teams client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to load a malicious library. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file in a specific location on the targeted system. This file will execute when the vulnerable application launches. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with the privileges of another user&rsquo;s account.",
