            "description": "A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco Prime License Manager (PLM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP POST requests that contain malicious SQL statements to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify and delete arbitrary data in the PLM database or gain shell access with the privileges of the postgres user.",
