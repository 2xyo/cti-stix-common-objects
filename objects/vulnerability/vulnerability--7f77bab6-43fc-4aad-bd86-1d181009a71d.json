NOTE: the vendor has disputed this vulnerability, stating that the \"XSS flaw was only part of the custom implementation of the [polopoly] site\".  As of 20061003, CVE has no further information on this issue, except that the original researcher has a history of testing live sites and assuming that discoveries indicate vulnerabilities in the associated package.",
