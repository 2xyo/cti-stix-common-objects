            "description": "Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing 2-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. In versions 4.27.4 and earlier, utilizing a HTTP query parameter an attacker is able to redirect users from the web application to any domain, including potentially malicious sites. This security issue does not directly impact the security of the web application itself. As a workaround, one can use a reverse proxy to strip the query parameter from the affected endpoint. There is a patch for version 4.28.0.",
