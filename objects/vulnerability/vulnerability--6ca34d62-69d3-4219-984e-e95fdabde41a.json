            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager v7.2.699 build 1001. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the content parameter provided to the script_test.jsp endpoint. A crafted content request parameter can trigger execution of a system call composed from a user-supplied string. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the web service. Was ZDI-CAN-5080.",
