            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE M875 (All versions). The web interface on port 443/tcp could allow a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if an unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link. Successful exploitation requires user interaction by an legitimate user, who must be authenticated to the web interface as administrative user. A successful attack could allow an attacker to interact with the web interface as an administrative user. This could allow the attacker to read or modify the device configuration, or to exploit other vulnerabilities that require authentication as administrative user. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",
