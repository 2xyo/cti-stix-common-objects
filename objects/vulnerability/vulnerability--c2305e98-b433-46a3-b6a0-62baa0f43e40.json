            "description": "An issue was discovered in EspoCRM before 5.6.9. Stored XSS was executed on the Preference page as well as while sending an email when a malicious payload was inserted inside the Email Signature in the Preference page. The attacker could insert malicious JavaScript inside his email signature, which fires when the victim replies or forwards the mail, thus helping him steal victims' cookies (hence compromising their accounts).",
