By connecting to the Mosquitto broker on an access point and one of its clients, an attacker can gather enough information to craft a command that reboots the client remotely when sent to the client's Mosquitto broker, aka \"unauthenticated remote command execution.\" This command can be re-sent endlessly to act as a DoS attack on the client.",
