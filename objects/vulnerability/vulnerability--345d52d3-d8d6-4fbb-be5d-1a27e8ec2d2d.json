This vulnerability is due to improper restrictions on software logging features used by the application on Windows operating systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to visit a website designed to submit malicious input to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to modify files and execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the targeted user.",
