As of today, we are not aware of any Prisma users or external consumers of the `@prisma/sdk` package who are affected by this security vulnerability. This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. It only affects the `getPackedPackage` function and this function is not advertised and only used for tests & building our CLI, no malicious code was found after checking our codebase.",
