            "description": "A vulnerability in the video endpoint API (xAPI) of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient path validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command request to the xAPI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read the contents of any file that is located on the device filesystem.",
