NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information. In addition, the demonstration code as used by third parties suggests that this might be a different type of vulnerability related to shell metacharacters.  Finally, this could be a rediscovery of CVE-2004-1430.",
