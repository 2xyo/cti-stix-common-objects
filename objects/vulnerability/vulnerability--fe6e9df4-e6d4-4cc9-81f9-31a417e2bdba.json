            "description": "Receipt of a crafted or malformed RSVP PATH message may cause the routing protocol daemon (RPD) to hang or crash. When RPD is unavailable, routing updates cannot be processed which can lead to an extended network outage. If RSVP is not enabled on an interface, then the issue cannot be triggered via that interface. This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3. This issue does not affect Junos releases prior to 16.1R1.",
