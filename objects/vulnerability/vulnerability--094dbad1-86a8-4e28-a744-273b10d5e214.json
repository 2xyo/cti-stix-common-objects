By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the victim. IBM X-Force ID: 179537.",
