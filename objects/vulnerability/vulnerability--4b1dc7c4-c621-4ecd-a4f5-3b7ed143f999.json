            "description": "A vulnerability in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) feature of Cisco Meeting Server software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for users of XMPP conferencing applications. Other applications and processes are unaffected. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of XMPP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted XMPP packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause process crashes and a DoS condition for XMPP conferencing applications.",
