            "description": "Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer (on 32-bit systems ONLY) can be exploited using the `STRALGO LCS` command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-29477 which only addresses the problem on 64-bit systems but fails to do that for 32-bit. 64-bit systems are not affected. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the `STRALGO LCS` command.",
