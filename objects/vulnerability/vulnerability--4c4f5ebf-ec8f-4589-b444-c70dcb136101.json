            "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose information on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 15.1.3-47255. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handler for HOST_IOCTL_INIT_HYPERVISOR in the prl_hypervisor kext. The issue results from the exposure of dangerous method or function to the unprivileged user. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-10518.",
