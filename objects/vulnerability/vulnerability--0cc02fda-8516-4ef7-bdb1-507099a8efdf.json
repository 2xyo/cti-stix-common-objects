Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of NVBUPolicy Get method requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the underlying database. Was ZDI-CAN-4229.",
