NOTE: due to the lack of information in the original sources, it is likely that this candidate will be REJECTed once it is known which implementations are actually vulnerable.  In addition, since \"denial of service\" is an impact and not a vulnerability, it is unknown which underlying vulnerabilities are actually covered by this particular candidate.",
