The vulnerability is due to excessive mapped connections exhausting the allotted resources within the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large amounts of inbound traffic to a device with the intention of overloading certain resources. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc39260.",
