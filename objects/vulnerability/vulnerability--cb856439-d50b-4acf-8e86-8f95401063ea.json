The vulnerability is due to an overly permissive Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. An exploit could allow the attacker to communicate with the API and exfiltrate sensitive information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh99208.",
