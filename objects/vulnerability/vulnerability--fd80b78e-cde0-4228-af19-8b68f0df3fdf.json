            "description": "A vulnerability in the TCP normalizer of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software (8.0 through 8.7 and 9.0 through 9.6) and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause Cisco ASA and FTD to drop any further incoming traffic on all interfaces, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper limitation of the global out-of-order TCP queue for specific block sizes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of unique permitted TCP connections with out-of-order segments. An exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available blocks in the global out-of-order TCP queue, causing the dropping of any further incoming traffic on all interfaces and resulting in a DoS condition.
