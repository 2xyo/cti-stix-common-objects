            "description": "A Server-side request forgery (SSRF) flaw was found in Ansible Tower in versions before 3.6.5 and before 3.7.2. Functionality on the Tower server is abused by supplying a URL that could lead to the server processing it. This flaw leads to the connection to internal services or the exposure of additional internal services by abusing the test feature of lookup credentials to forge HTTP/HTTPS requests from the server and retrieving the results of the response.",
