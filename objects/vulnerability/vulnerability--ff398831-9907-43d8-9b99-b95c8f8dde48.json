            "description": "A remote authenticated arbitrary command execution vulnerability was discovered in Aruba AirWave Management Platform version(s): Prior to 8.2.12.0. Vulnerabilities in the AirWave web-base management interface could allow remote authenticated users to run arbitrary commands on the underlying host. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a lower privileged user on the underlying operating system leading to partial system compromise.",
