            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.",
