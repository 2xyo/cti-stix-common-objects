Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of CGI scripts. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-11369.",
