            "description": "In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, if a user passes a list of strings to `dlpack.to_dlpack` there is a memory leak following an expected validation failure. The issue occurs because the `status` argument during validation failures is not properly checked. Since each of the above methods can return an error status, the `status` value must be checked before continuing. The issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.",
