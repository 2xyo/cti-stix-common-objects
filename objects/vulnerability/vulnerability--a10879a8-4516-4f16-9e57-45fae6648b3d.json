            "description": "Locale module and dependent contributed modules in Drupal 6.x before 6.16 and 5.x before version 5.22 do not sanitize the display of language codes, native and English language names properly which could allow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the 'administer languages' permission.",
