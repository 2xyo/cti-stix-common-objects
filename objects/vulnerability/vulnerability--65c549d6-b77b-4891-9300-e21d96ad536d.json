            "description": "A denial of service vulnerability in Juniper Networks NorthStar Controller Application prior to version 2.1.0 Service Pack 1 may allow an unauthenticated, local user, to create a fork bomb scenario, also known as a rabbit virus, or wabbit, which will create processes that replicate themselves, until all resources are consumed on the system, leading to a denial of service to the entire system until it is restarted. Continued attacks by an unauthenticated, local user, can lead to persistent denials of services.",
