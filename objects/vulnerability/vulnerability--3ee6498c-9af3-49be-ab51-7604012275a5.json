            "description": "A vulnerability in the anycast gateway feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a device to learn invalid Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) entries. The ARP entries are for nonlocal IP addresses for the subnet. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of a received gratuitous ARP (GARP) request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious GARP packet on the local subnet to cause the ARP table on the device to become corrupted. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to populate the ARP table with incorrect entries, which could lead to traffic disruptions.",
