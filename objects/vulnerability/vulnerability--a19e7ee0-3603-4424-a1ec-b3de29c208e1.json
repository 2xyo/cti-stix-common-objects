            "description": "An issue was discovered on Sannce Smart HD Wifi Security Camera EAN 2 950004 595317 devices. By default, a mobile application is used to stream over UDP. However, the device offers many more services that also enable streaming. Although the service used by the mobile application requires a password, the other streaming services do not. By initiating communication on the RTSP port, an attacker can obtain access to the video feed without authenticating.",
