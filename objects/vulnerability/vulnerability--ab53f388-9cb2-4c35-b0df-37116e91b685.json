            "description": "An access control weakness in the DTMF tone receiver of Fermax Outdoor Panel allows physical attackers to inject a Dual-Tone-Multi-Frequency (DTMF) tone to invoke an access grant that would allow physical access to a restricted floor/level. By design, only a residential unit owner may allow such an access grant. However, due to incorrect access control, an attacker could inject it via the speaker unit to perform an access grant to gain unauthorized access, as demonstrated by a loud DTMF tone representing '1' and a long '#' (697 Hz and 1209 Hz, followed by 941 Hz and 1477 Hz).",
