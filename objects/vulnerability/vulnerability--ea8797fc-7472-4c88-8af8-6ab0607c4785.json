            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Joyent Smart Data Center prior to agentsshar@1.0.0-release-20160901-20160901T051624Z-g3fd5adf (e469cf49-4de3-4658-8419-ab42837916ad). An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the docker API. The process does not properly validate user-supplied data which can allow for the upload of arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-3853.",
