            "description": "A vulnerability in the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server component of Cisco Expressway software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security controls and send network traffic to restricted destinations. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of specific connection information by the TURN server within the affected software. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending specially crafted network traffic to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send traffic through the affected software to destinations beyond the application, possibly allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized network access.",
