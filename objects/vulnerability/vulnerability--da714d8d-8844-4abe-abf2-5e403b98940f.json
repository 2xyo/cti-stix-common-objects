            "description": "A vulnerability in the sfmgr daemon of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform directory traversal and access directories outside the restricted path. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a relative path in specific sfmgr commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on an sftunnel-connected peer device.",
