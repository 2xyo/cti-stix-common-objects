NOTE: this issue is disputed by the Google Security Team, who states that \"Google does not provide the 'search.php' script referenced.  When a user creates a custom search engine, we provide them with a block of javascript to include on their site.  Some users write additional code around this block of javascript to further customize their website.\"",
