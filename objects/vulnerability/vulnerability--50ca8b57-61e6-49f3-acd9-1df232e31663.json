            "description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This vulnerability is an instance of an out of bounds read vulnerability in the MakeAccesible plugin, when handling font data. It causes an out of bounds memory access, which sometimes triggers an access violation exception. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by using the out of bounds access for unintended reads, writes, or frees, potentially leading to code corruption, control-flow hijack, or an information leak attack.",
