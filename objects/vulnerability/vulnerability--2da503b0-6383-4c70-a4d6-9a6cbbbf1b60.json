A user with elevated privileges could upload a photo to the system in an SVG format. This file will be uploaded to the system and it will not be stripped or filtered. The user can create a link on the website pointing to \"/storage/poc.svg\" that will point to http://localhost/pagekit/storage/poc.svg. When a user comes along to click that link, it will trigger a XSS attack.",
