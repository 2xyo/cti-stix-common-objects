Information disclosure is a very common issue that attackers will attempt to exploit as a first pass across the application. As they probe the application they will take note of anything that may seem out of place or any bit of information they can use to their advantage such as error messages, system information, user data, version numbers, component names, URL paths, or even simple typos and misspellings.",
