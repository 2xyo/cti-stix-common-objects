            "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of D-Link DIR-867, DIR-878, and DIR-882 routers with firmware 1.20B10_BETA. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of HNAP requests. The issue results from incorrect string matching logic when accessing protected pages. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the router. Was ZDI-CAN-10835.",
