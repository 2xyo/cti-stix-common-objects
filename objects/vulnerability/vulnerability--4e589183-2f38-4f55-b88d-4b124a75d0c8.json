Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of CGI scripts. When parsing the errorpage request parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-11856.",
