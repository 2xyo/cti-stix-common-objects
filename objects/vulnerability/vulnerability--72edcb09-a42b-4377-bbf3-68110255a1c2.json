This issue is exposed on virtual servers using a Policy Enforcement profile or a Web Acceleration profile. Systems that do not have BIG-IP AAM module provisioned are not vulnerable. The Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) may restart and temporarily fail to process traffic. Systems that do not have BIG-IP AAM or PEM module provisioned are not vulnerable.",
