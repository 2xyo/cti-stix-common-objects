            "description": "A vulnerability in the WLAN Local Profiling feature of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect parsing of HTTP packets while performing HTTP-based endpoint device classifications. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition.",
