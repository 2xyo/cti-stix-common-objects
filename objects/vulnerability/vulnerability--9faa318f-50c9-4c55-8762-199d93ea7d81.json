A user on the network with the ISI_PRIV_AUTH_SSH RBAC privilege that has an expired account may potentially exploit this vulnerability, giving them access to the same things they had before account expiration. This may by a high privileged account and hence Dell recommends customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.",
