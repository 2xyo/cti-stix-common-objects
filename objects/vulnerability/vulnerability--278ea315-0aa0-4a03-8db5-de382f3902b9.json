            "description": "A vulnerability in the preloading mechanism of specific dynamic link libraries in McAfee Agent for Windows prior to 5.7.3 could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL preloading attack with unsigned DLLs. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. This would result in the user gaining elevated permissions and being able to execute arbitrary code.",
