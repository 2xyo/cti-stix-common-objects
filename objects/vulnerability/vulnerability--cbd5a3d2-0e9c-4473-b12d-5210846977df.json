            "description": "JustSystems Ichitaro 2016 Trial contains a vulnerability that exists when trying to open a specially crafted PowerPoint file. Due to the application incorrectly handling the error case for a function's result, the application will use this result in a pointer calculation for reading file data into. Due to this, the application will read data from the file into an invalid address thus corrupting memory. Under the right conditions, this can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
