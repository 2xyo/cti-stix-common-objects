            "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R7800 firmware version 1.0.2.76. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the vendor_specific DHCP opcode. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-12216.",
