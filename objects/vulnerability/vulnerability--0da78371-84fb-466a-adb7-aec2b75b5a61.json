            "description": "A vulnerability in the cluster database (CDB) management component of Cisco Expressway Series Software and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the CDB process on an affected system to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of URL requests by the REST API of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to the REST API of the affected software on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CDB process on the affected system to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve77571.",
