A use-after-free vulnerability exists in httpd-simple.c in cc26xx-web-demo httpd, where upon a connection close event, the http_state structure was not deallocated properly, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference in the output processing function. This resulted in a board crash, which can be used to perform denial of service.",
