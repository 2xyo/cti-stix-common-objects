By sending a specially crafted authentication request to the affected systems a remote attacker could escalate his privileges to an elevated user account but not to root. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems. Successful exploitation requires no privileges and no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",
