The device\u2019s vulnerability in the web application could allow multiple unauthenticated attacks that could cause serious impact. The vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands and send a request to a specific URL that could cause the device to become unresponsive. The unauthenticated attacker may change the password of the 'configuration' user account, allowing the attacker to modify the configuration of the device via the web interface using the new password. This vulnerability may also allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the authentication required to configure the device and reboot the system.",
