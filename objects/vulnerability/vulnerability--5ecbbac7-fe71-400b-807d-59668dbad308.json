In the \\app\\admin\\controller\\themecontroller.php file, the check_bad() function's filtering is not strict, resulting in PHP code execution. This occurs because some dangerous PHP functions (such as \"eval\") are blocked but others (such as \"system\") are not, and because \".php\" is blocked but \".PHP\" is not blocked.",
