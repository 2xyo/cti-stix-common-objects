            "description": "A vulnerability in the web server functionality of Cisco Enterprise Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform file enumeration on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to the web server responding with different error codes for existing and non-existing files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending GET requests for different file names. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate files residing on the system.",
