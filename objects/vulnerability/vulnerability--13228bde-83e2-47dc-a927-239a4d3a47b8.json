On the backend of the device's web interface, there are some diagnostic tests available that are not displayed on the webpage; these are only accessible by crafting a POST request with a program like cURL. There is one test accessible via cURL that does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to execute shell commands as the root user.",
