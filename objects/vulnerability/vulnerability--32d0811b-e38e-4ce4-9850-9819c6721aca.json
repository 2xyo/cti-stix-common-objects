            "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Admin portal of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. These vulnerabilities are due to improper enforcement of administrator privilege levels for sensitive data. An attacker with read-only administrator access to the Admin portal could exploit these vulnerabilities by browsing to one of the pages that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information regarding the configuration of the system. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.",
