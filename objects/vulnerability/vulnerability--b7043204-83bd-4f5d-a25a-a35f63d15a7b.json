            "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. Sniffed passwords from SMAdata2+ communication can be decrypted very easily. The passwords are \"encrypted\" using a very simple encryption algorithm. This enables an attacker to find the plaintext passwords and authenticate to the device. NOTE: the vendor reports that only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.",
