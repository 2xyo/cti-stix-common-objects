            "description": "** DISPUTED ** In IQrouter through 3.3.1, the Lua function diag_set_password in the web-panel allows remote attackers to change the root password arbitrarily. Note: The vendor claims that this vulnerability can only occur on a brand-new network that, after initiating the forced initial configuration (which has a required step for setting a secure password on the system), makes this CVE invalid. This vulnerability is \u201ctrue for any unconfigured release of OpenWRT, and true of many other new Linux distros prior to being configured for the first time\u201d.",
