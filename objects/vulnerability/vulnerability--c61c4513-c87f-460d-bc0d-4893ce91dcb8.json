            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Quest NetVault Backup 11.2.0.13. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within nvwsworker.exe. When parsing the boundary header of a multipart request, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-4215.",
