NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the Oracle July 2008 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on reliable researcher claims that this issue is a buffer overflow that allows attackers to cause a denial of service (database corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long argument to an unspecified procedure.",
