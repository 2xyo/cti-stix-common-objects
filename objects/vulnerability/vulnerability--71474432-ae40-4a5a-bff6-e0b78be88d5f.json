            "description": "The Quest Kace K1000 Appliance, versions prior to 9.0.270, allows a remote attacker to exploit the misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) mechanism. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance\u2019s settings. A malicious internal user could also gain administrator privileges of this appliance and use it to visit a malicious link that exploits this vulnerability. This could cause the application to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance\u2019s settings. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could add an administrator-level account or change the appliance's settings.",
