            "description": "** DISPUTED ** The PhonePe wallet (aka com.PhonePe.app) application 3.0.6 through 3.3.26 for Android might allow attackers to perform Account Takeover attacks by intercepting the user name and PIN during the initial configuration of the application.  NOTE: the vendor says that, to exploit this, the user has to explicitly install a malicious app and provide accessibility permission to the malicious app, that the Android platform provides fair warnings to the users before turning on accessibility for any application, and that it believes it is similar to installing malicious keyboards, or malicious apps taking screenshots.",
