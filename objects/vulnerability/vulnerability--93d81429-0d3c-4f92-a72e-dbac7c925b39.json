The vulnerability is due to improper inclusion of sensitive information in downloadable files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a specific set of commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain hashed credentials of system users. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to have valid user credentials with elevated privileges.",
