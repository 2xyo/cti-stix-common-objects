            "description": "A memory leak flaw was found in WildFly in all versions up to 21.0.0.Final, where host-controller tries to reconnect in a loop, generating new connections which are not properly closed while not able to connect to domain-controller. This flaw allows an attacker to cause an Out of memory (OOM) issue, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
