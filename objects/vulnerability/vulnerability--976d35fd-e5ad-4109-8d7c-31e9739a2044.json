            "description": "Forcepoint User ID (FUID) server versions up to 1.2 have a remote arbitrary file upload vulnerability on TCP port 5001. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to remote code execution. To fix this vulnerability, upgrade to FUID version 1.3 or higher. To prevent the vulnerability on FUID versions 1.2 and below, apply local firewall rules on the FUID server to disable all external access to port TCP/5001. FUID requires this port only for local connections through the loopback interface.",
