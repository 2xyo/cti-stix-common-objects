            "description": "A vulnerability in the orchestration tasks of Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a path traversal attack on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input on the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a task with specific configuration parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the file system of an affected device.",
