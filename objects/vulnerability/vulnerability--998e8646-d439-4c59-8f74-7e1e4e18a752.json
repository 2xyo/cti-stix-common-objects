            "description": "setup before version 2.11.4-1.fc28 in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux added /sbin/nologin and /usr/sbin/nologin to /etc/shells. This violates security assumptions made by pam_shells and some daemons which allow access based on a user's shell being listed in /etc/shells. Under some circumstances, users which had their shell changed to /sbin/nologin could still access the system.",
