            "description": "An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource allocation handling of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering errors while parsing mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this vulnerability through decoding of the domain name performed by rr_decode.",
