NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the March 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is an integer overflow in the Java Runtime Environment that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a JPEG image that contains subsample dimensions with large values, related to JPEGImageReader and \"stepX\".",
