A vulnerability in the AirWave web-based management interface could allow an authenticated remote attacker to improperly access and modify devices and management user details. A successful exploit would consist of an attacker using a lower privileged account to change management user or device details. This could allow the attacker to escalate privileges and/or change network details that they should not have access to.",
