            "description": "A vulnerability in the container management subsystem of Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain elevated privileges. This vulnerability is due to an insecure default configuration of the Kubernetes container management subsystem within DNA Center. An attacker who has the ability to access the Kubernetes service port could execute commands with elevated privileges within provisioned containers. A successful exploit could result in a complete compromise of affected containers. This vulnerability affects Cisco DNA Center Software Releases 1.1.3 and prior. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi47253.",
