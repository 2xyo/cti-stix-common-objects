            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to generate valid, signed session tokens. The vulnerability is due to a static signing key that is present in all Cisco HyperFlex systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the static signing key from one HyperFlex system and using it to generate valid, signed session tokens for another HyperFlex system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the HyperFlex Web UI of a system for which they are not authorized.",
