            "description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Jabber for Windows Client could allow an authenticated, local attacker to retrieve user profile information, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input- and validation-checking mechanisms in the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specific commands after authenticating to the system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view profile information where only certain parameters should be visible. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve14401.",
