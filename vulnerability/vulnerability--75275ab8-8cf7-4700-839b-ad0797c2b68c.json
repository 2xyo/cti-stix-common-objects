            "description": "A vulnerability in the Smart Licensing Manager service of the Cisco Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) and Firepower 9300 Security Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that could be executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain Smart Licensing configuration parameters. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by configuring a malicious URL within the affected feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Firepower Security products running FX-OS code trains 1.1.3, 1.1.4, and 2.0.1 (versions 2.1.1, 2.2.1, and 2.2.2 are not affected): Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall and Firepower 9300 Security Appliance.
