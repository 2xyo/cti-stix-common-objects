            "description": "An issue was discovered in the server in OpenLDAP before 2.4.48. When the server administrator delegates rootDN (database admin) privileges for certain databases but wants to maintain isolation (e.g., for multi-tenant deployments), slapd does not properly stop a rootDN from requesting authorization as an identity from another database during a SASL bind or with a proxyAuthz (RFC 4370) control. (It is not a common configuration to deploy a system where the server administrator and a DB administrator enjoy different levels of trust.)",
