Note: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that DB02 is for a race condition in the RLMGR_TRUNCATE_MAINT trigger in the Rules Manager and Expression Filter components changing the AUTHID of a package from DEFINER to CURRENT_USER after a TRUNCATE call, and DB06 is for SQL injection in the DBMS_APPLY_USER_AGENT.SET_REGISTRATION_HANDLER procedure, which is later passed to the DBMS_APPLY_ADM_INTERNAL.ALTER_APPLY procedure, aka \"Oracle Streams\".",
