            "description": "The administration console of the Moog EXO Series EXVF5C-2 and EXVP7C2-3 units features a 'statusbroadcast' command that can spawn a given process repeatedly at a certain time interval as 'root'. One of the limitations of this feature is that it only takes a path to a binary without arguments; however, this can be circumvented using special shell variables, such as '${IFS}'. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as 'root' on the units.",
