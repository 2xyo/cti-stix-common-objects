NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is an integer overflow that triggers memory corruption via large values in a subsample of a JPEG image, related to JPEGImageWriter.writeImage in the imageio API.",
