            "description": "A vulnerability in the guest shell feature of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read and send packets outside the scope of the guest shell container. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to perform this attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient internal security measures in the guest shell feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending or receiving packets on the device-internal network outside of the guest shell container, aka \"Unauthorized Internal Interface Access.\" This vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules.
