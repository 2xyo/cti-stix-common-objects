            "description": "An improper input validation vulnerability in the configuration daemon of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Panorama allows for a remote unauthenticated user to send a specifically crafted registration request to the device that causes the configuration service to crash. Repeated attempts to send this request result in denial of service to all PAN-OS Panorama services by restarting the device and putting it into maintenance mode. This issue affects: All versions of PAN-OS 7.1, PAN-OS 8.0; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.14; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.7; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than 9.1.0.",
