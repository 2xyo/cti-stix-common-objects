            "description": "In all Android releases (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) from CAF using the Linux kernel, radio_id is received from the FW and is used to access the buffer to copy the radio stats received for each radio from FW. If the radio_id received from the FW is greater than or equal to maximum, an OOB write will occur. On supported Google Pixel and Nexus devices, this has been addressed in security patch level 2018-08-05.",
