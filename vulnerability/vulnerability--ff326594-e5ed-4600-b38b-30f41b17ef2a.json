By visiting the page found at /console/ConsolePage/Master.html, an attacker is able to see the markup that would be presented to an authenticated user. This is caused by the session validation occurring after the initial markup is loaded. This results in a list of unprotected API endpoints that disclose call logs, SMS logs, and user-account data.",
