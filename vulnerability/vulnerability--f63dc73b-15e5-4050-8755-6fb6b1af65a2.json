            "description": "An issue was discovered in FNET through 4.6.4. The code that initializes the DNS client interface structure does not set sufficiently random transaction IDs (they are always set to 1 in _fnet_dns_poll in fnet_dns.c). This significantly simplifies DNS cache poisoning attacks.",
