            "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the LINE jp.naver.line application 8.8.0 for iOS. The LAContext class for Biometric (TouchID) validation allows authentication bypass by overriding the LAContext return Boolean value to be \"true\" because the kSecAccessControlUserPresence protection mechanism is not used. In other words, an attacker could authenticate with an arbitrary fingerprint.  NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes iOS devices on which a jailbreak has occurred.",
