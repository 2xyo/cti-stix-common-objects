NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the April 2009 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on reliable researcher claims that this issue is a format string vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in an HTTP POST URI, which are not properly handled when logging to opmn/logs/opmn.log.",
