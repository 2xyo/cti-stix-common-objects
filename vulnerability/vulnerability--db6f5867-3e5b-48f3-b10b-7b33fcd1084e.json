            "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the WinRing0x64 Driver Privileged I/O Read IRPs functionality of NZXT CAM 4.8.0. A specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) Using the IRP 0x9c4060cc gives a low privilege user direct access to the IN instruction that is completely unrestrained at an elevated privilege level. An attacker can send a malicious IRP to trigger this vulnerability and this access could allow for information leakage of sensitive data.",
