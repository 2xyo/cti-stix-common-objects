            "description": "In tinysvcmdns through 2018-01-16, an mDNS server processing a crafted packet can perform arbitrary data read operations up to 16383 bytes from the start of the buffer. This can lead to a segmentation fault in uncompress_nlabel in mdns.c and a crash of the server (depending on the memory protection of the CPU and the operating system), or disclosure of memory content via error messages or a server response.
