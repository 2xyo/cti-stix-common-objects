SQL injection vulnerability in Memberlist.php in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1.1 rc1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the start parameter.  NOTE: the vendor says that since only one character can be modified, there is no SQL injection. Thus this might be an \"invalid SQL syntax error.\"  Multiple followups support the vendor.",
