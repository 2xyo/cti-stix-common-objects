The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf36682.",
