            "description": "A vulnerability in the DHCP server of Cisco Prime Network Registrar could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming DHCP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a restart of the DHCP server process, causing a DoS condition.",
