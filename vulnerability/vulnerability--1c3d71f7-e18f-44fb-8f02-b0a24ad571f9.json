(The endpoint would need to be already compromised for exploitation to succeed.) This affects Pulse Desktop Client 5.x before Secure Desktop 5.3R7 and Pulse Desktop Client 9.x before Secure Desktop 9.0R3. It also affects (for Network Connect customers) Pulse Connect Secure 8.1 before 8.1R14, 8.3 before 8.3R7, and 9.0 before 9.0R3.",
