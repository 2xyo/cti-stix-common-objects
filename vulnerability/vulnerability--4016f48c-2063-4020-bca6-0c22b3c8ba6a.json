            "description": "An unrestricted file upload issue in HorizontCMS through 1.0.0-beta allows an authenticated remote attacker (with access to the FileManager) to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a PHP payload, and then using the FileManager's rename function to provide the payload (which will receive a random name on the server) with the PHP extension, and finally executing the PHP file via an HTTP GET request to /storage/<php_file_name>. NOTE: the vendor has patched this while leaving the version number at 1.0.0-beta.",
