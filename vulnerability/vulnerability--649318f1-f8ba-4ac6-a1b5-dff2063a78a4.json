            "description": "A vulnerability in the USB-modem code of Cisco IOS XE Software running on Cisco ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the platform usb modem command in the CLI of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying the platform usb modem command in the CLI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve48949.",
