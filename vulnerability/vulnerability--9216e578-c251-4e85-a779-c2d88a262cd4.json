            "description": "VMware Workstation 5.5.3 build 34685 does not provide per-user restrictions on certain privileged actions, which allows local users to perform restricted operations such as changing system time, accessing hardware components, and stopping the \"VMware tools service\" service. NOTE: exploitation is simplified via (1) weak file permissions (Users = Read & Execute) for %PROGRAMFILES%\\VMware; and weak registry key permissions (access by Users) for (2) vmmouse, (3) vmscsi, (4) VMTools, (5) vmx_svga, and (6) vmxnet in HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\; which allows local users to perform various privileged actions outside of the guest OS by executing certain files under %PROGRAMFILES%\\VMware\\VMware Tools, as demonstrated by (a) VMControlPanel.cpl and (b) vmwareservice.exe.",
