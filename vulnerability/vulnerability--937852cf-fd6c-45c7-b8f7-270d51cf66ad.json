NOTE: the original vulnerability report contains several significant inconsistencies that make it unclear whether the report is accurate, including (1) PB-DB is really the \"PunkBuster Screenshot Database\" and not \"PunkBuster\" itself; (2) there is no apparent association between PunkBuster and \"Punky Brewster\"; (3) the claimed source code is not anywhere in Alpha 6.",
