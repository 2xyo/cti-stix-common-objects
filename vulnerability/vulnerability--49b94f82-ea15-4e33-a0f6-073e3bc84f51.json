            "description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.x before 4.1.4. If the input of the function SSHParseBanner is composed only of a \\n character, then the program runs into a heap-based buffer over-read. This occurs because the erroneous search for \\r results in an integer underflow.",
