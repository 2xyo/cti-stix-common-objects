NOTE: the vendor and original researchers have released a follow-up comment disputing the severity of this issue, in which the researcher states that \"we mentioned that there was a previously known Firefox vulnerability that could result in a stack overflow ending up in remote code execution. However, the code we presented did not in fact do this... I have not succeeded in making this code do anything more than cause a crash and eat up system resources\".",
