            "description": "Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. In Vela compiler before version 0.6.1 there is a vulnerability which allows exposure of server configuration. It impacts all users of Vela. An attacker can use Sprig's `env` function to retrieve configuration information, see referenced GHSA for an example. This has been fixed in version 0.6.1. In addition to upgrading, it is recommended to rotate all secrets.",
