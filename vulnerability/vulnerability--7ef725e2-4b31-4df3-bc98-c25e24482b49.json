            "description": "ad-ldap-connector's admin panel before version 5.0.13 does not provide csrf protection, which when exploited may result in remote code execution or confidential data loss. CSRF exploits may occur if the user visits a malicious page containing CSRF payload on the same machine that has access to the ad-ldap-connector admin console via a browser. You may be affected if you use the admin console included with ad-ldap-connector versions <=5.0.12. If you do not have ad-ldap-connector admin console enabled or do not visit any other public URL while on the machine it is installed on, you are not affected. The issue is fixed in version 5.0.13.",
