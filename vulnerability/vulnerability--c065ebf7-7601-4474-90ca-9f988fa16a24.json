            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and get limited access to the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of authentication in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication request to the web-based management interface on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view limited configuration details and potentially upload a virtual machine image.",
